# amp-up.io QTI 3 Player Component

The amp-up.io QTI 3 Player Component ("QTI 3 Player") is a 100% JavaScript component that aims to encapsulate the best practices and behaviors of the IMS Global QTI 3 Assessment Item specification which can be found here:

[IMS Global QTI v3 Best Practices and Implementation Guide](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/qti/v3p0/impl)

A conforming QTI 3 authoring or exporting system can construct a QTI 3 Item XML solution that will "play" authentically and reliably - according to the Best Practices Implementation Guide - in the QTI 3 Player component.
