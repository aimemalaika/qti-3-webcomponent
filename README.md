# amp-up.io QTI 3 Player Component

The amp-up.io QTI 3 Player Component ("QTI 3 Player") is a 100% JavaScript component that aims to encapsulate the best practices and behaviors of the IMS Global QTI 3 Assessment Item specification which can be found here:

[IMS Global QTI v3 Best Practices and Implementation Guide](https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/qti/v3p0/impl)

A conforming QTI 3 authoring or exporting system can construct a QTI 3 Item XML solution that will "play" authentically and reliably - according to the Best Practices Implementation Guide - in the QTI 3 Player component.

For a complete list of the QTI3 XML elements supported by the QTI 3 Player component, please refer to the [QTI 3 Player Item Reference](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KCImUAk-2uBqSOHRO1lJa1orrzF4b8cl/#heading=h.gjdgxs).

This component would not be possible were it not for a fortuitous decision by the aQTI working group - meeting at CITO headquarters in Arnhem, NE, January 2015 - to make QTI3 "web component friendly".
